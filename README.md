# Top Scorers Application
# Task 

Write a program which takes as input a CSV file listing people and the score they achieved in a test, and which outputs the top scorers, those people with the highest marks, as well as what that mark was.
If there are two or more top scorers, the program should output all of them in alphabetical order. For instance, in the given TestData.csv file, the output should be:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasinU1/Ninety-One-Test.git
```
# To Run the script 

```bash
python3 main.py
```

# To Run the Tests 

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_top_scorers.py
```
